NEP Custom Data Import Application
==================================

The **NEP Custom Data Import Application** is a standalone Grails application that was developed
by [2Paths Solutions Ltd.](https://www.2paths.com) for [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu)  to support a 
data repository for their National Evaluation Platforms (NEP).

From 2014 through 2017, four African countries â€” Malawi, Mali, Mozambique, and Tanzania are building their own National 
Evaluation Platforms, with technical guidance from the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) Institute for International 
Programs (IIP) and funding support from the Government of Canada. Public institutions are leading actors in every aspect 
of NEP's development and use. Each country has identified a "home institution" to manage NEP by maintaining the data, 
conducting analyses, and leading hands-on capacity-building workshops with teams of other public sector NEP 
stakeholders. A national steering committee of high-level leaders from stakeholder institutions identifies priority 
evaluation questions and receives NEP findings.

The NEP hosts its data repository with DHIS 2, and the **NEP Custom Data Import App** facilitates the 
import of data in csv format into DHIS 2. The application supports both Tracker (Survey) data, and Aggregate Data Set
data (eg: Census data). 
  
Please see the NEP Custom Data Import Manual for a full description of the system and its functionality:

[BSD license](http://www.linfo.org/bsdlicense.html) and is free for everyone to install and use.

University (JHU)](https://www.jhu.edu) and was finalized for the purposes of the project on July 31, 2017.
