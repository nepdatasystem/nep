The following files are example files to be used for Survey Uploads.  They were downloaded from www.dhsprogram.com, and have been processed using R code that can be found in the NEP Data System Library on statsreport.org 

These example files are from the 2010 DHS Household survey from Malawi, which contains Household, Women, and Child data.  The Household database are referred to as respondent data, in DHIS2, and the Women, and Child databases are referred to as program stages in DHIS2.

The column headings are server-instance specific, but these example files are based off of the default configuration for an English language instance.
